# Solutions to question and assignments of Fundamentals of Digital Image and Video Processing
Course page is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/digital)
I have used the provided Matlab online workspace to work on problems.
They are usually catagorised in two forms

- `week#_qs.m` which include a workbook style to get to solutions of the quiz, which don't require us to use `Matlab` and could be done by hand or paper, however it was easier to just write a program 
- `Week#_as.m` which refer to the final question or the assignment of the week (usually a longer problem)

At the moment they are all put on same folder, since some of the codes of earlier weeks could be reused.
